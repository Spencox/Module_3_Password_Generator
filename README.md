# Module_3_Password_Generator
Random password generator that takes user input. 

## Description

This site provides a user with a customized random password based off what characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) the user chooses. I learned how to utilize custom and built in JavaScript functions to help accomplish the project requirements.

## Usage

This webpage provides a very simple user interface that involves pushing a button to kick off the password generations function. After the user selects the link:

After selecting the button the user will be prompted to enter a numerical value from 8 to 128 characters for the desired length of password:

Note: if you don not enter a number between 8 and 128 then you will be reprobated:

After an appopriate value is entered by the user then a series of 4 confirm boxes will pop up asking for the type of characters to be used:

Ex.
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/characters.png)

The user will need to select OK for yes or Cancel for No.

If the user selects cancel for all values then an alert will pop up stating you did not pick any character types and start the process over:

If all steps are done correctly by user then the randomly generated password will display on screen:
